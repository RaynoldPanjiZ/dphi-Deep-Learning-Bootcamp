From the link above, which contains the zip file,
The extracted file will get five files:

* train : contains all the images that are to be used for training.
* Training_set.csv : this csv file has contains the labels for the training images.
* test : contains 9000+ images. For these images, there are required to make predictions.
* Testing_set.csv : this is the order of the predictions for each image that is to be submitted on the platform.
* sample_submission.csv : this is the sample submission file for the data sprint.
